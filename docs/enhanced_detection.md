# Enhanced Meeting Join Detection

## Problem Identified
The bot IS successfully joining the Zoom meeting (confirmed by user), but the SDK callback `onMeetingStatusChanged` is not being called with `MEETING_STATUS_INMEETING`. This indicates a callback processing issue, not a join issue.

## Root Cause
The GMainLoop callback system may not be processing SDK callbacks properly, causing the status change from CONNECTING to INMEETING to be missed.

## Enhanced Solution - Dual Detection System

### 1. Callback Debugging
```cpp
void onMeetingStatusChanged(MeetingStatus status, int result) override {
    std::cout << "\n[CALLBACK] onMeetingStatusChanged called! Status: " << status;
    // ... detailed callback logging
}
```

### 2. Active Status Polling (Backup Detection)
```cpp
// Check meeting status every 5 seconds
guint statusUpdateId = g_timeout_add_seconds(5, [](gpointer data) -> gboolean {
    auto status = service->GetMeetingStatus();
    
    if (status == MEETING_STATUS_INMEETING) {
        std::cout << "[ACTIVE DETECTION] Bot successfully joined meeting!";
        eventHandlerRef->meetingJoined = true;
        g_main_loop_quit(timeoutMainLoop);
    }
    
    return status == MEETING_STATUS_CONNECTING;  // Continue until success/failure
}, meetingService);
```

### 3. Callback System Health Check
```cpp
// Verify GMainLoop is processing callbacks
guint callbackTestId = g_timeout_add_seconds(10, [](gpointer data) -> gboolean {
    std::cout << "[CALLBACK TEST] GMainLoop is processing callbacks correctly";
    return TRUE;
}, nullptr);
```

## How This Solves the Issue

### Scenario 1: Callbacks Work Properly
- `onMeetingStatusChanged` gets called with `MEETING_STATUS_INMEETING`
- Normal callback-based detection works
- Active polling confirms the status

### Scenario 2: Callbacks Fail (Current Issue)
- `onMeetingStatusChanged` never gets called
- **Active polling detects `MEETING_STATUS_INMEETING`**
- Manually sets `meetingJoined = true`
- Exits main loop successfully

### Scenario 3: Complete Failure
- Neither callbacks nor polling detect success
- Timeout triggers after 2 minutes
- Clear error message with troubleshooting info

## Expected Behavior

```
Join request sent! Waiting for meeting events...
[CALLBACK TEST] GMainLoop is processing callbacks correctly
[ACTIVE STATUS CHECK] Current meeting status: 1 (CONNECTING - still trying...)
[CALLBACK TEST] GMainLoop is processing callbacks correctly
[ACTIVE STATUS CHECK] Current meeting status: 2 (IN MEETING - SUCCESS DETECTED!)
[ACTIVE DETECTION] Bot successfully joined meeting!
[ACTIVE DETECTION] Exiting main loop due to successful join

Analyzing meeting join results...
Successfully joined the meeting!
Bot is now in the meeting. Press Ctrl+C to exit...
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Dual Detection**: Both callback and polling mechanisms
2. **Fast Response**: 5-second polling for quick detection
3. **Callback Debugging**: See if callbacks are working at all
4. **Robust Fallback**: Active polling works even if callbacks fail
5. **Health Monitoring**: Verify GMainLoop is functioning

This should finally detect when the bot successfully joins the meeting, regardless of whether the SDK callbacks are working properly!
